# Workflow Guardrails
1. Before starting any new task, establish fresh workspace-safety evidence and inspect recent progress. Reuse that evidence only while the branch/worktree and relevant Git state remain unchanged. For Superplan-routed work, ask whether to use a new worktree before any mutation when meaningful Git changes risk overwrite, commit mixing, or conflicts; ignore insignificant noise. Before a required human-decision pause after current-task mutations, validate and create a task-scoped checkpoint commit without including pre-existing, unrelated, or known-invalid state. When the task is done, create a separate commit for that task's changes.
2. At task start, check workspace compatibility, then inspect progress through compact human summaries/exact entries and the plan catalog; read full registries only for repair or cross-entry analysis. Update progress when complete. Plans live under `./docs/superplan/plans`.
3. For structural plan changes, run exhaustive global validation, search all statuses for source/dependency/scope/artifact candidates, and read the changed plan plus discovered related closure in full; use local plan/index validation for routine progress updates.
4. For work routed through Superplan, the approved plan, delivery-loop risk profile, and artifact-aware verification matrix are the project-level authority for persisted artifacts, testing, verification, delegation, and task-level traceability. Reuse unaffected evidence instead of rerunning unchanged checks.

# 第一规范

1. skill 说明要精简，不用啰嗦重复，与 AI 能力重复部分不需要写，只要增加微小说明即可。
2. 不要为了优化而优化，如果优化收益低，应该拒绝优化，正确是第一优化原则。
